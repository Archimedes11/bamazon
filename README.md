## **OVERVIEW**
This program uses **MySql** and **Node.js** to create a primitive buy/sell program that
allows users to buy items from 'BAMAZON'. The program uses the MySql database to
store information regarding an item's ID, price, stock quantity, the product's name,
and the department name for the item.

### **PURPOSE**
This program lets user play around with an imaginary, simple, buying platform. The user is
asked which item they would like to purchase and then how many of that item they would like to purchase.  If the amount of the stock quantity is lower than the amount of product requested by the user, the program lets the user know that there isn't enough product and the sale is cancelled. **The user can press 'q' or 'Q' at anytime to quit the program.**

### **SETUP**
The user must start the node application.
